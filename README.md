## Short Description

A implementation of the classic game "Battleship".

## Demo

üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://optobimus.github.io/battleship/">Live Demo</a>

## Showcase

The user is first required to put in his name. Then he will position his ships and after that the game can start! Taking turns with the computer, the user will aim and shoot at the computer field, hoping to hit the enemy ships.
I also implemented a logic for the AI to shoot "intelligently", aiming for adjacent tiles after making a hit for example.
